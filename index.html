					<p>
						I had the opportunity to get involved in the associative life of the ESSEC campus by joining MELT, an association which aims to integrate international students through different events promoting the cultural diversity of the school. I was also able to get involved with EMMAUS France, and more precisely the Friperie Solidaire which is a social reintegration project. During these experiences, I was able to take responsibilities, work in a team, and put forward qualities and aptitudes that are necessary to become a committed citizen.
